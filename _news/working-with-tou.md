I've started working as a contractor at [Tomorrow University](https://www.tomorrow.university/), an online edtech startup based in Berlin.
The impressive [Ana-Maria Olteteanu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anamariaolteteanu/)—my former research supervisor in [Bremen]()—is the AI program director there and needs some help designing courses on AI and Machine Learning.
I'll also be helping her execute various research agendas as time permits. I'm excited to be involved!
