**tl;dr** â€” We're moving to London in January so that Zoe can become even more awesome, and also I quit my job at Grant Street Group.

***

Zoe has been in search of a program that will help her on her way to becoming a garden designer. She could enroll in a Master of Landscape Architecture program, but that's overkill for her purposes (2 years long and _expensive_). So she started searching abroad and found an impressive program at the [London College of Garden Design](https://www.lcgd.org.uk/). Long story short, she applied and got accepted!  :partying_face:

This means that we're moving to England. The program is 6 months, comprising a couple of full-day classes per week along with a lot of project work. It isn't necessarily meant to be a full-time thing, but it does look like a fair bit of work. There are also a few 2- or 3-week breaks throughout. So what are we doing during those breaks and in our downtime? Exploring of course!

I'm officially leaving Grant Street Group this month and becoming a full-time travel buddy for Zoe. I've been thinking about making a transition to a new position somewhere for a while, and this will be the perfect opportunity to cut ties and take a break before diving back into the job market.

While we're in London, I'll take some time to refresh any rusty skills and think carefully about where I want to work next. I'm sure I will also spend plenty of time planning trips to other parts of Europe and exploring the city, because it would be crazy to go all that way and not take advantage of it!

It's a new adventure, and we couldn't be more excited.
