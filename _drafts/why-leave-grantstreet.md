- Although I love the company, the nature of the work at Grant Street isn't exactly cutting-edge. A lot of the work is with old systems in old languages, and isn't helping me learn or grow as rapidly as I'd like.

- Working remotely is nice and flexible, and because of it we've been able to move all over the country (and even work from Scotland and Mexico for extended periods). However, it does _not_ lend itself to making friends. I'd love an actual office with coworkers who live in the same area to try and encourage a real social life.

- A significant portion of my graduate coursework at CMU involved data science, big data, and machine learning. I loved it! But I haven't gotten to do much with it since graduating. I want to find a position that gets me back into that arena, somewhere a little more specific to my education.
