@string{comrat_abs = {The Remote Associates Test (RAT) has been used to measure creativity, however few repositories or standardizations of test items exist, like the normative data on 144 items provided by Bowden and Jung-Beeman. comRAT is a computational solver which has been used to solve the compound RAT in linguistic and visual forms, showing correlation to human performance over the normative data provided by Bowden and Jung-Beeman. This paper describes using a variant of comRAT, comRAT-G, to generate and construct a repository of compound RAT items for use in the cognitive psychology and cognitive modeling community. Around 17 million compound Remote Associates Test items are created from nouns alone, aiming to provide control over (i) frequency of occurrence of query items, (ii) answer items, (iii) the probability of coming up with an answer, (iv) keeping one or more query items constant and (v) keeping the answer constant. Queries produced by comRAT-G are evaluated in a study in comparison with queries from the normative dataset of Bowden and JungBeeman, showing that comRAT-G queries are similar to the established query set.}}
@string{ieee_abs = {This poster presents an initial set of observations on different strategies of solving a creativity test under difficult conditions. Human participants show a propensity to answer with a stronger associate of one or two of the query items, while less frequently responding with a weaker but more inclusive associate of all three. Additionally, solvers sometimes responded with answers that held functional relations to the query item(s), even when instructed to provide a compound solution. These strategies of falling back on semantic or strongly occurring associates are explored, together with some of their implications on the design of adaptive mechanisms for cognitive systems.}}
