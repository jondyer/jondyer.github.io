I recently accepted a position as a Software Development Engineer on the Amazon [AWS SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) team, where we build Amazon's flagship machine learning platform. Prior to this I spent some time traveling and working as a Research Engineer for [Tomorrow University of Applied Sciences](https://www.tomorrow.university/), where I helped design technical courses on machine learning and AI. Before that I was a full-stack software engineer at [Grant Street Group](https://www.grantstreet.com/) for several years.

My long-term goal is to move into a position as a Machine Learning Engineer, with the ultimate objective of becoming involved in [technical AI alignment research](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/). Although I've enjoyed my time as a software engineer, I miss the theory and math of machine learning, which was a core focus of my graduate studies.

When I'm not staring at a screen trying to understand [RLHF](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf) or [ELK](https://ai-alignment.com/eliciting-latent-knowledge-f977478608fc), you can probably find me [cooking](https://foodandcheer.me/g/home), rock climbing, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/jondyer), or traveling with my family.

You can reach me by [email](mailto:jbdyer@alumni.cmu.edu) or at one of the links above.
