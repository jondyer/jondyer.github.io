I am currently working as a freelance consultant for the [Tomorrow University of Applied Sciences](https://www.tomorrow.university/), where I help with learning design for technical courses on machine learning and AI. Prior to this I worked for several years as a full-stack software engineer at [Grant Street Group](https://www.grantstreet.com/).

My goal at the moment is to find a new full-time position as a Machine Learning Engineer, with the ultimate objective of becoming involved in [technical AI alignment research](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/). Although I've enjoyed my time as a software engineer, I miss the theory and math of machine learning, which was a primary focus of my graduate studies.

When I'm not staring at a screen trying to understand [RLHF](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf) or [ELK](https://ai-alignment.com/eliciting-latent-knowledge-f977478608fc), you can probably find me [cooking](https://mealie.foodandcheer.me/explore/recipes/home), rock climbing, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/jondyer), or traveling with my family.

You can reach me by [email](mailto:jbdyer@alumni.cmu.edu) or at one of the links above.
